## Staking Mechanisms

### Locked Staking
```javascript

const stakeTokens = async (amount, duration) => {
  const stakingContract = await getStakingContract();
  
  const stakeTransaction = await stakingContract.stake(amount, duration);
  await stakeTransaction.wait();
  
  const stakeInfo = await stakingContract.getStakeInfo(userAddress);
  return {
    stakedAmount: stakeInfo.amount,
    lockPeriod: stakeInfo.lockPeriod,
    rewards: stakeInfo.rewards,
    unlockTime: stakeInfo.unlockTime
  };
};
```

### Flexible Staking

  const annualReward = stakedAmount * (apy / 100);
  const dailyReward = annualReward / 365;
  const totalReward = dailyReward * timeStaked;
  
  return {
    stakedAmount,
    apy,
    timeStaked,
    dailyReward,
    totalReward,
    effectiveAPY: (totalReward / stakedAmount) * (365 / timeStaked) * 100
  };
};
```

### Reward Distribution
